<h3><strong>How did the whole idea come about?</strong></h3>
<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/captured_Image.png.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="captured_Image.png" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/captured_Image.png_thumb.png" border="0" alt="captured_Image.png" width="183" height="185" align="right" /></a> Kids Wish Network was formed after our founder, Shelley Breiner, accompanied her father, who was undergoing chemotherapy treatments, to the hospital and saw many children battling terrible illnesses.  The faces of these brave children inspired her to start Kids Wish Network and reach out to children in crisis across the country.
<h5><strong>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</strong></h5>
Kids Wish Network is moved by so many stories of children who are fighting for their lives.  We want to be able to give these very deserving children a bit of hope and a special memory that will stay with them forever.  We hope that others see the importance of our work and see how important children are.
<h3><strong>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</strong></h3>
We are currently up for a $50,000 grant in the Pepsi Refresh Project which will allow us to send 25 wish kids to the Florida theme parks.  Vote daily at <a href="http://kidswishnetwork.org/pepsi">http://kidswishnetwork.org/pepsi</a> and by texting 103927 to 73774. Tell your friends and vote everyday!
<h5><strong>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</strong></h5>
Always keep your goal in mind.  Our goal is to reach as many children as we can.  Because of this, we have established other programs and additional ways to help children in crisis.  The most important thing for us is reaching out to our kids and putting smiles on their faces.
<h3><strong>How has social media helped your organization?</strong></h3>
Social media has helped Kids Wish Network spread the word about our organization and our children.  By using different platforms, we are able to find supporters, donors and friends who have stood by us and helped us get the word out about what we do.
<h5><strong>What do you have planned for the future of </strong>Kids Wish Network<strong>?</strong></h5>
Hopefully, we will be able to develop more programs, grant more wishes and reach out to more children.  We are always coming up with new ideas and new ways to make a difference in the lives of our children.  We are excited for what the future will bring.

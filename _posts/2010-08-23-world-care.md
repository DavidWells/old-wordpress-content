This weeks cause of the week is <a href="http://www.worldcare.org/"><strong>World Care.org</strong></a>

Like a lot of organizations that come into contact with socialize your cause, their organization’s genesis was spurred when a group of  people travel to a remote location and have their eyes opened to how fortunate they really are.

In this case it was  a group of healthcare workers from Washington D.C. traveled to Guatemala. Among them was Lisa Hopper, founder of World Care.

Lisa realized, after their initial healthcare analysis, that the real need was not for the complex medical technologies that they thought, but the very basic life nurturing necessities like food, shelter, and <strong>above all education.</strong>

<strong>Thus, World Care was born!</strong>

<strong>Now they run a ton of <a href="http://www.worldcare.org/Tools/default.asp?ID=523">great programs</a> to help countries all over the world with education, health, environmental, and emergency relief efforts.</strong>

<strong>Make sure to <a href="http://twitter.com/WorldCareAZ">follow them on Twitter</a> and look out for their tweets coming from our accounts this week @SocializedCause @CauseofTheWeek and @YouCanHelp.</strong>

<h3><a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/haiti_home_image.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2869" style="margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;" title="haiti" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/haiti_home_image.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="191" /></a>How did the whole idea come about?</h3>
World Care started when our CEO Lisa Hopper, had a recurring dream of herself standing in the desert, surrounded by cardboard boxes marked "World Care."  When the dream wouldn't stop, she took it as a sign that she should do more to help those in need.  Thus, World Care was born in Lisa's garage in 1996 as a school supply drive for Southern Arizona students, and has been growing ever since.
<h5>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</h5>
As a college student, I first became passionate about World Care's cause when I took a class about social entrepreneurship taught by Lisa.  She taught us about the basics of a non profit and expanded the curriculum from there as we discovered the plight of people in various nations.  From there I became an intern at World Care and discovered the vast amount of work that the non profit does on a daily basis.  Many organizations are focused on one aspect of need, but World Care provides assistance in every area of life from education to disaster relief.
<h3>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</h3>
World Care always accepts donations from the public.  Anything that we receive at the World Care warehouse can be put toward one of our four programs.  We have extensive refurbishing programs for used items including computers, electronics and medical equipment.  If the donated item cannot be reused, World Care makes an impact by recycling that item in the proper manner to ensure environmental safety and preservation.  All donations can be sent year round to 3538 E. Ellington Pl.
<h5>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</h5>
World Care is a testament to the fact that anyone can make a difference if they are passionate about the cause.  You don't have to be well connected or wealthy to start a non profit, all it takes is knowledge about the area where you want to help and the drive to continue when the going gets rough.  Lisa Hopper is proof that anyone can achieve tremendous goals, even if they start with small roots.
<h3>How has social media helped your organization?</h3>
As a relatively small non profit, World Care is just beginning to utilize the world of social media.  Through the recent creation of a Twitter, Facebook page and the ongoing development of a new website, World Care hopes to reach out to the public and spread our cause.  By getting the World Care name out there, we hope to connect with potential donors and other non profits who are working to change the world.
<h5><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What do you have planned for the future of World Care?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h5>
World Care is in the midst of a very promising time right now.  We are currently expanding all of our programs to reach out to as many recipients as possible.  Because of the economic and ecological climate at the moment, World Care is needed more than ever, and has been devoted to work in Haiti, Syria and North Korea.  These projects will continue in the months to come, as well as the support of potential disaster zones around the world.  World Care is finishing up another year of Tools for Schools, and will now begin to focus donations on Tools for Health, especially our Medical Free Loaner program, and on Tools for Earth, with a newly expanded recycling program and partnership.

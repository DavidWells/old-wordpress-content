A wise man once said:

<blockquote>"Four eyes see more than two."</blockquote>

This sparks the thought about support systems.

Friends, family, colleagues, and mentors.

Not much can be done in life without the support of others. We stand upon the shoulders of giants and we should be wise to remember it.

When faced with a particularly vexing problem, having a third party give you their take can be extremely valuable. 

It doesn't always solve the problem but it sheds light on it from a different angle and sometimes that's all it takes.

Who do you ask? Who would you like to ask? Why don't you ask them?

You are unlikely to get an answer or a third party viewpoint if you don't ask.

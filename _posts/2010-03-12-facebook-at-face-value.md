<a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>&rsquo;s Graduate School of Business recently conducted a study on the effectiveness of Facebook marketing by teaming up with a Houston, Texas sweet spot called <a href="http://www.dessertgallery.com/">Dessert Gallery</a> Bakery and Caf&eacute;.&nbsp; The results of this study (&ldquo;How Effective is Facebook Marketing&rdquo;) are featured in an upcoming edition of the Harvard Business Review.

Dessert Gallery had no social media presence before the study began, so all of the data is a direct result of the Facebook page that was created.&nbsp; Here is an excerpt from an <a href="http://www.casestudiesonline.com/uploads/TranscriptGalleryBakery.pdf">interview</a> with Utpal Dholakia, associate professor of marketing from Rice University&rsquo;s Jones Graduate School of Business, and Sara Brook, the owner of Desert Gallery, that explains both the general idea behind and process of this case study:

&ldquo;So social media is very popular these days and for the last couple of years everyone is interested in knowing about how Facebook works. &nbsp;How effective is Facebook marketing, and more importantly, how much they should invest in Facebook and Twitter and all those types of things.&nbsp; Given the fact that Sara didn&rsquo;t have a Facebook presence, that gave us an opportunity to really answer this question in a controlled way. &nbsp;So what was very appealing about this is we actually measured customers&rsquo; evaluations prior to the Facebook presence. &nbsp;Then we let the Facebook presence go on for about three months and Sara did a really good job of doing a lot of promotions. And then three months later we evaluated her customers&rsquo; responses regarding the store and how much they buy at the store, how much they recommend her store to friends, and so on.&rdquo;

Overall, Rice researchers claim that membership on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dessert-Gallery-Bakery-Cafe/94510147325?ref=share#!/pages/Dessert-Gallery-Bakery-Cafe/94510147325?v=wall&amp;ref=share">Facebook fan page</a> changed customer behavior for the better.&nbsp; Facebook fans made more visits to Dessert Gallery, spent more money at Dessert Gallery, were more likely to recommend Dessert Gallery to friends, and also had a greater emotional attachment to the company.

One of the most helpful/important lessons learned in this study Dholakia noted was about the use of <strong>promotions</strong>:

&ldquo;It turns out that the quality of the content, the types of promotions you run, are extremely important in how successful Facebook marketing is. In fact that is the <strong>biggest driver</strong>. So it&rsquo;s not enough to just have a Facebook Fan Page and then expect that you&rsquo;re going to have a very effective and successful marketing program.&rdquo;

For example, when Sara&rsquo;s daugther&rsquo;s 20<sup>th</sup> birthday came around she was away at college and couldn&rsquo;t celebrate at home, but Sara decided to have a party at the bakery anyway.&nbsp; She announced it on Facebook &ndash; &ldquo;All of my customers in the community, if your name is Jennifer, come in on September 25th for a free slice of Jennifer&rsquo;s birthday cake.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a huge success.

Promotions can be a strong incentive to grow your follower base within social media channels. There is a great&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to grab advocates and supporters on Facebook.

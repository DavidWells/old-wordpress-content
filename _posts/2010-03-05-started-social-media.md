<a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/">Chris</a> points out social media is free and inexpensive, moves fast, presents an opportunity to humanize/ show passion, and many times can have a larger impact than most traditional marketing channels.
<h5>Notables:</h5>
<strong>1.</strong> Most tools are free and/or inexpensive (i.e. blogging, podcasts, and videos – specifically sites like Facebook, Twitter, &amp; Wordpress).

<strong>2.</strong> These tools give opportunity to <em>humanize</em>; a video gives viewers the opportunity to see a face (face&gt;text) and <strong>passion</strong> is visualized.  If you are trying to raise awareness for a cause try uploading a video on your website/blog of you explaining it or (if possible) actually doing it.

<strong>3.</strong> A message moves QUICKLY through social media without taking much of your time or money.

<strong>4.</strong> Larger impacts can be made using social media over traditional marketing channels.
<h3>Chris’  Tips for Easily Getting Started in Social Media:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;"><strong>Find </strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">where your target  market is interacting and build an account (Twitter, Facebook, Wordpress = free)</span></li>
	<li><strong> Build</strong> out profile – decide what you are/are not interested in sharing</li>
	<li>Upload a picture/video = <strong>humanize</strong> your profile</li>
	<li>LISTEN/OBSERVE:  for example, go to “<a href="http://search.twitter.com/" target="_blank">search.twitter.com</a>” and see what people are talking about &amp; are interested in.  This also gives you the opportunity to see how others who are interested in the same things utilize a particular social media/networking tool.  You can start out by modeling their behavior until you get the hang of it.</li>
	<li><strong>Follow</strong> them &amp; build your social network—it becomes organic</li>
	<li>Don’t be afraid to <strong>experiment</strong></li>
</ul>

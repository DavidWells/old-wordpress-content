You have a mission that is important to you and a lot of other people, so you should be doing everything you can to promote it. No matter what the cause is, there are people who will support it if they know about it.

Listed here are 10 Twitter promotional tips for non profit organisations that you can use to spread the word about your mission, distribute news and updates, and gain moral and financial support.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Build a following:</span></strong> You can search hash tags like #nonprofit and those related to your non profit’s mission. By following those who follow other non profit organisations, you can get in touch with a lot of people involved in similar efforts. When you follow someone, often they follow you in return. Get started this way, and eventually others will follow you because of what you are doing.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enlist VIP support:</span></strong> By direct messaging influential people at the community, state, and national level, you can get some to retweet your messages and even send out their own tweets about your cause. That helps spawn viral campaigns that bring in lots of support.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be professional:</span></strong> Use a real photo of yourself or use the logo for the non profit you are advocating. Avoid misspellings and stay on topic. Acting silly or behaving strangely will turn off donors.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retweet:</span></strong> If you see tweets related to your non profit or non profits in general, retweet them. If you only tweet your own stuff, you won’t come across as a social player. Chris Brogan recommends retweeting others content at a 10 to 1 ratio.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spread out your tweets:</span></strong> You have a lot to say and you are very busy, but if you schedule all your tweets for one time, you will come across as a spammer and get blocked by potential supporters. Tweet throughout the day and you will get a better response.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Add value to Twitter</span></strong><strong>:</strong> Don’t just post junk. If you have a blog, be sure to tweet your posts so that everyone gets to read about the activities of your non profit. Don’t be afraid to add new information about your mission, donor trends, or even the status of the non profit industry. Be adding quality content you become relevant.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicate:</span></strong> Use the direct message function in Twitter to stay in touch with workers in your group, stay in touch with donors, and to reach out to potential beneficiaries. With Twitter, communication is fast and easy.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get help:</span> </strong>If you have questions that need answers, suggestions for your operation, or opinions about your Web site, ask for it on Twitter. There are millions of people out there who are willing to help with their two-cents.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Track your progress:</span></strong> Set up Google Alerts (http://www.google.com/alerts) to keep track of what people are saying about you and your non profit. If you aren’t showing up much on the Web, your message may not be penetrating. This kind of information will help you manage your reputation and tweak your message so more people respond to it.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t be oversensitive:</span></strong> When you’re on Twitter, some people won’t like your message. Some may even put you down. Others may stop following you. These kinds of things happen all the time. Like all social media, Twitter takes time and effort to build it into something with tangible benefits.

These 10 Twitter promotional tips for non profit organizations will help you build awareness of your cause and generate more revenue to make a difference in your world. Get started today and you’ll be surprised how much Twitter will help you reach your organisational goals.

<a href="http://www.microaid.org/">MicroAid</a>, an Indonesian based Charity Organization, has set out on a mission. That misson is to help alleviate financial hardship and poverty in their community and others. They help by funding <a href="http://www.microaid.org/?q=donate/microproject">MicroAid projects</a> that include various forms of enterprise skills training and work experience; self-help training groups, local market surveys and visits; and by supporting  family businesses with materials and grants.<a href="http://www.microaid.org/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1537 alignright" title="microaid2" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/microaid2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="158" /></a>

Many of the poverty stricken families of Indonesian homes are unaware of what opportunities exist to improve their families annual income levels. By learning new skills through various MicroAid projects, these families are able to leverage their time and apply these new skills to bring in much needed additional income.

MicroAid Projects have worked with more than 800 lower income families in Kenya, India, Ghana, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Uganda and Cambodia last year.

They are truly making a difference in the lives of these lower income families and because of their tremendous work, they have been chosen as our Cause of the Week!
<h3>How did the whole idea come about?<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/microaid1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px 2px; display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="microaid" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/microaid_thumb1.jpg" border="0" alt="microaid" width="244" height="155" align="right" /></a></h3>

Too often family enterprises funded by micro-credit lacked the expertise and profitability to do more than simply repay loans made.  Simple technical training from local experts can transform low income family subsistence enterprises into viable sustainable livelihoods.  MicroAid Projects started as a family charity in Indonesia giving small micro aid only to low income families to increase profitability of their livelihoods.  In 2002, with his son Toby and Jalu Wardhana in the Indonesian field office,  MicroAid Projects methodology was set up on the internet creating a virtual donations channel from profitable families in Europe and America to poor families struggling to come from behind.
<h5><strong>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</strong></h5>

From a reasonably well off background, I have always had the spare cash necessary to take a risk learn from experience good and bad.  Poor families, living on the edge, cannot take this risk. Others who have established their own profitable lives should encourage others to use MicroAid’s virtual donation channel. Only through MicroAid Projects can you directly help poor families together with others online and receive reports by email in text, photos and sometimes video.

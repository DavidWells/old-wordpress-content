<a href="http://beckoningforchange.org"><strong>Beckoning for Change</strong></a> is a network of <a href="http://beckoningforchange.org/category/artists/filmmakers-artists/"><strong>filmmakers</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://beckoningforchange.org/category/artists/musicians/"><strong>musicians</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://beckoningforchange.org/category/artists/photographers/"><strong>photographers</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://beckoningforchange.org/category/artists/writers/"><strong>writers</strong></a><strong>, and other </strong><a href="http://beckoningforchange.org/category/artists/multimedia-artists/"><strong>multimedia artists</strong></a> who are using their talents and abilities to effect change.

We are are big fan of the arts here at Socialize Your Cause and we have chosen Beckoning for Change as this week's cause of the week!

Launched in New York City in August of 2009, <strong>Beckoning for change</strong> is a collaborative organization connecting concerned artists and other like minded individuals and organizations that care about creating change by using their natural gifts. We think it's fantastic what they are doing by bringing together talented individuals and giving back.

<h3>How did the whole idea come about?</h3>
<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/musicforgood.png"><img style="margin: 0px; display: inline; border: 0px;" title="music for good" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/musicforgood_thumb.png" border="0" alt="music for good" width="244" height="219" align="right" /></a> I had the privilege of growing up in various parts of the world such as Iran, Turkey, Canada and the US.  I witnessed and experienced many social injustices and various perceptions of freedom.   In my quest to play a role in creating change, I decided to create a platform that would give a voice to these various global perspectives.   A voice that is authentic and on the pulse of social consciousness.  Historically the arts have played as a vehicle for social activism and raising awareness on a global scale.  It became clear that artists were the best instruments, as agents for social change.

Beckoning for Change was formed during a graduate class at the Milano School of Nonprofit Management and Urban Policy.  The concept was pitched in a fundraising and development class in 2009 and launched that same summer.  Eleanor Cicerchi, a graduate teacher of the program became a valuable mentor and eventually the founding board member of the organization.

<h5><strong>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should others support it? </strong></h5>
This cause is close to my heart because I believe we need to develop global consciousness.  The arts can awaken the heart and spirit in a way no other discipline can achieve.  As we tackle various social causes, it is instrumental to draw from the voices of artists, as global citizens, whom represent various socio economic and cultural perspectives.

We'll also be announcing two major B4C events, taking place this summer.  The first would be a music festival and the second an art exhibition.  Both will be focusing on the concept of Freedom.

What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?

My advice is to believe in your inner voice and align yourself with people that support the course of the vision.

My most practical advice is to find a way to create financial security without compromising your integrity.
<h3>How has social media helped your organization?</h3>
I think social media has served as a great instrument in building a global following.
<h3>What do you have planned for the future of Beckoning for Change?</h3>
As a MSc Candidate of Corporate Social Responsibility, I'm looking forward to learning ways of engaging the private sector in future B4C endeavors.

In the coming year, we'll be announcing partnerships with key change-driven organizations to develop a stronger voice and promote events around the world focused on justice, interdependence, sustainability and freedom.

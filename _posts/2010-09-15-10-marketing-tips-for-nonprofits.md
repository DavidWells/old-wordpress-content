Whether you run a for-profit business or a charity organization, you still need to use marketing techniques to get your message heard. Many of the same rules apply. Write great ad copy, have a stunning website and use social networking to bring the message to the masses. Here are ten great marketing techniques for your non-profit organization.

<strong>

Target your audience:</strong> What services do you offer? Decide your demographic and design your marketing materials around them. Pay more attention to your target audience than your donors. Hard selling techniques will turn people away. Talk to those who need your organization.

<strong>2. Newsletter:</strong> Ask your donors to opt-in to a newsletter. Talk about your organization's accomplishments and give helpful advice to people who will use your services. Offer testimonials to let donors know the value of the services that you're offering - they want to know that they are making a difference.

<strong>3. Website:</strong> Your organization's website is often the first point-of-contact for a potential donor. When making their decision, a donor will go to your website for inspiration. Keep the message clear. If they see that your website is pandering to them, they are less likely to donate to your cause.

<strong>4. Use a tag line:</strong> The tag line states the purpose of the organization, especially if the name is not obvious. Place the tag line near your organization's logo or incorporate it into the logo. If you provide meals to the homeless, your readers should know that within the first few seconds of landing on your site.

<strong>5. Provide a donation button:</strong> Donors want to know what services your organization offers. Entice your readers to give by placing a donation button at the bottom of your web page. This will eliminate the hassle of having to make a call. Someone can click the button and immediately feel good that they donated to a worthy cause.

<strong>6. Clear copy:</strong> Your advertising copy needs to be clear. Your charity may offer countless services to the community. Multiple choices confuse people. When you focus on the benefits of one service, you set people at ease. Make a call to action at the end of the piece. Use action words to state your case.

Social networking:</strong> Social networking is a valuable tool for any non-profit. Set up accounts in Facebook and Twitter. When you complete your profile, be aware of the benefits that your service provides. Ask that the volunteers friend or follow your organization. That way, you can leverage your base following into receiving new donors.

<strong>8. Posting on social networking:</strong> Do not spend all of your time specifically marketing your organization. Share resources and articles with other members of your community. Talk about what is going on behind the scenes. This gives donors the impression that they know you and that they can feel comfortable with you.

<strong>9. Look for links:</strong> Always be aware of the other organizations in your area. See if there are links which can be established. You might offer food to the homeless while another provides shelter. Non-profits, like companies, have different strengths. Seek out joint ventures which will help both of your organizations thrive.

<strong>10. Toot your own horn:</strong> People want to know about your accomplishments. How many people did you get off the streets? How much food have you provided? Donors will donate to you if they feel that they will be part of the winning team. Prove that you are winning.

Marketing is essential for any organization. By using your social network, writing clear copy and seeking joint ventures you can expand your donor list beyond your wildest dreams.

<strong>What is it that you do? </strong>

Can it be summed up in a sentence or is it ambiguous?

<blockquote>I always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more specific.

-Jane Wagner</blockquote>

I think there is a big problem today with too many folks generalizing their skill-sets and spreading themselves too thin.

Jack of all trades and masters of none.

Instead of specializing and becoming the best at something, people tend to generalize their skills and fall into mediocrity.

The <strong>only way</strong> to find your specialty is by trying many things and finding what sets you on fire.

Once you land on something that moves you. <strong>Chase it with everything you have.</strong>

Take a long shot.

You will fail many times along the way. You might even fail completely. 

But failure is merely a stepping stone to your final destination and eventually luck will give you your shot. Take it.

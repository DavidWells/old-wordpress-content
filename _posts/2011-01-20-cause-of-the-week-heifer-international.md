I recently had the honor of interviewing Casey Neese, Heifer International's  Social Networking Marketing Manager about their organization.

<strong>How did the whole idea come about?</strong>

The idea of Heifer started in 1944 from our founder, Dan West. He was a Midwestern farmer who was working as a relief worker handing out rations of milk to hungry children during the Spanish Civil War. After being forced to decide who would receive the limited rations and who wouldn’t – he knew this kind of aid would never be enough.

West then decided that the only way to end hunger permanently would be to provide families with the training and livestock they needed to become self-sufficient. Here is a <a href="http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.201520/">link </a>to their founder's story.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should others support it?</strong></li>
</ul>
Heifer’s mission envisions a world of communities living together in peace and equitably sharing the resources of a healthy planet. We work very hard to teach others how to live with the resources that are given to them.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</strong></li>
</ul>
We have a program called Team Heifer where we encourage our supporters to help raise money by involving others. You can join a current team or start one of your own. Each team sets a monetary goal to raise money for Heifer. This really encourages and excites supporters to get everyone they know involved.
<ul>
	<li><strong>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</strong></li>
</ul>
Think big! It’s amazing how many people you can get involved in a Team Heifer project when you announce it to groups and activities you are involved in. We offer funding raising ideas and can help you spread the word to everyone you know.
<ul>
	<li><strong>How has social media helped your organization?</strong></li>
</ul>
We have been able to use social media to listen and engage with our donors. The timeliness of social media helps keep our supporters immediately updated on projects and events going on in the US and around the world in an instant.
<ul>
	<li><strong>What do you have planned for the future of </strong><strong>Heifer International</strong><strong>?</strong></li>
</ul>
We are very fortunate that Heifer keeps growing even during tough economic times. Our supporters, volunteers and staff work hard every day to help spread Heifer’s mission. We know one day we will see the end of hunger and poverty.

<blockquote>"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." -Heraclitus Of Ephesus</blockquote>

Everything that you do, whether its for the first time or the hundredth, is a unique experience, or at least it <strong>could be.</strong>

It's hard to envision remedial repetitive tasks in your day to day life as different. The fact remains though, you are different than you were yesterday and the task at hand doesn't have to play out like it always does.

A culmination of the experiences of yesterday have shaped you into the person you are today.

Each moment a drop in the bucket that is you.

You shape those moments and have the power to influence the way they play out.

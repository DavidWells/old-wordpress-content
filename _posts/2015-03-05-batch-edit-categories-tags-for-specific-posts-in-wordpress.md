I just imported a blog with 400+ posts from Tumblr to WordPress and needed a way to bulk tag and bulk manage the categories of the imported posts.

Everything is lumped into ‘uncategorized’ so I needed a way to select specific posts at the same time and bulk categorize them

All plugins publicly avialable on the WordPress repo don’t let you select specific posts to bulk manage.

I found a plugin a while back that was great for this, unfortunately, its gone.

This plugin: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730063036/http://robm.me.uk/2006/12/13/batch-categories">Batch Categories</a> no longer exists from the original author or in the WordPress Repo.

But today is your lucky day!

I found it in an old folder. <a href="http://davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/dl/batch-categories.zip">Download it here</a>.
<h2>Heres how it works:</h2>
<h3>Go to bulk edit screen</h3>

<h3>Select all the posts that you want to edit</h3>

<h3>Choose the Action</h3>

You can add or remove the selected posts from the category you select. Or change the tags associated with all the posts selected
<h3>All Done. Easy as that!</h3>

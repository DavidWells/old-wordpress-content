By now, we are sure that everyone is well aware of the situation happening in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of joining in on the blame game with everyone else, we decided to look for people actually <strong>doing something</strong> to help the situation. There are <a href="http://www.secondact.com/2010/06/how-you-can-volunteer-to-clean-up-the-gulf-of-mexico-oil-spill/">a number</a> of cleanup and aid organizations on the case. One in particular caught our eye.

<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/adoptafisherman2.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="adopt a fisherman" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/adoptafisherman_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="adopt a fisherman" width="244" height="174" align="right" /></a>The John Tesh Radio Show has launched a humanitarian effort called <strong>"</strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/IntelligentKindness"><strong>Adopt A Fisherman</strong></a><strong>,"</strong> to help the many fishermen and their families who have lost their livelihood due to the massive oil spill.

This effort will be centered in Venice, Louisiana (Plaquemines Parish), roughly 75 miles south of New Orleans and considered the Gateway to the Gulf of Mexico. The area is home to many commercial fishermen.

The <strong>Adopt a Fisherman</strong> program is this weeks cause of the week and we hope you take a minute to read the interview we had with them and see what you can do to help. <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/IntelligentKindness?v=app_4949752878">You can donate to their cause here.</a></strong>

Because at the end of the day, pointing fingers at who is to blame for the horrible ecological disaster isn't going to help the situation get fixed any faster!

<h3>How did Intelligent Kindness come about?</h3>
<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/intelligencekindness1.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="intelligence kindness" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/intelligencekindness_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="intelligence kindness" width="187" height="504" align="right" /></a> We believe that it's important to live outside yourself and to help others less fortunate. We started this organization to get other people motivated to volunteer and help other people in need.
<h5>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</h5>
This is such a huge tragedy that we just wanted to do something immediately to help. These people that depend on fishing as a sole income will be effected for years to come. They need everyone's help, even if it's just $1.00. One dollar times 1,000,000 would help a lot of people.
<h3>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?*</h3>
We have the Sellecca Tesh Foundation which is music therapy for the elderly. They really are the forgotten generation and need to be remembered. Just taking a couple hours out of your weekend and visiting a convalescent home will lift the spirits of the residents and will make you feel great for giving your time.
<h5>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</h5>
Just do it. If you're thinking about it, then you should make it happen. Now with the miracle of the internet anything is possible. Social websites, Blogs, email, word of mouth, they are all powerful tools.
<h3>How has social media helped your organization?</h3>
Social media is amazing in that it reaches and connects people who otherwise would not have known about our organization.
<h3>What do you have planned for the future of Intelligent Kindness?</h3>
To spread the word to help others in any way possible. It's amazing how the smallest thing to you can make a monumental difference in someone else's life.
<h5>What can people do to help those effected by the oil spill?</h5>

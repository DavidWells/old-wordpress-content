I have recently been working for a company called <a href="http://www.teachstreet.com">Teachstreet.com</a> as a web researcher for their Featured Blogger Program. I have been looking at blogs from all over the world in various categories such as Religion, Physics and even Yoga.

Often I have come across blogs that have just decided to end because they have nothing left to say. Others have said that since they have started using social media such as Twitter and Facebook that they no longer have the desire to blog.

As a social media junkie (yes I can easily put in 30 hours a week on Facebook), I can honestly understand that it is very tempting to forgo blogging and just tweet and go on Facebook all day. I actually cut back on my social media all weekend, for the last three days I have not been on Facebook or Twitter more than ten minutes total, which is very minimal for me. When I did go back on Facebook to check my newsfeed there was so little to read about. I actually got more satisfaction from reading blogs that I had never seen before.

What would the social media world be like without blogs? Can you really fit all of your cause's information in just 140 characters?

Make sure you take the time to update the content on your cause's blog, at least once a week. There were so many great blogs that I saw over the last two weeks that have just fallen of the blogosphere. It was such a pity not to see them updated anymore. If you need some ideas for content, there are some great resources out there.
<h3>Here are some of my tips:</h3>
<strong>1) </strong>What time of the year is it? The holidays are a great time of the year to blog, there are so many concepts to write about. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Eid, Diwali, Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, Martin Luther King Day, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, see what I mean? Pretty much every month has a holiday.

<strong>2)</strong> Use current events to find ways to promote your cause. Natural disasters are a great way to remind people to donate to relief organizations. Unfortunately it often takes a disaster for people to realize that charity is needed.

<strong>3)</strong> Prevention is a great reason to blog. People need to do all kinds of things to prevent something else from happening. Staying organized, mow your lawn, winterize your home, change your oil, donate to causes (so they have enough to distribute), and so on. Think of donating as preventive maintenance- and blog about it.

<strong>4)</strong> Make sure you practice what you preach, if you talk about current events- make sure to show current events that your cause is participating. (I am also an event coordinator, so I hear about lots of non-profits having fundraisers)

<strong>5) </strong>If you don't have anything to blog about search the web for great bloggers and ask them to do a guest post in exchange for links. The key is getting links back to your website.

So what do you do once you've posted a blog? Tweet about it! Post it on Facebook, tell the world that you finally updated your blog. It's a great way to put a link to your blog or website and promote your cause once again.

Variety is the spice of life, even though it's difficult to change direction sometimes, it's always better once you have done something different.

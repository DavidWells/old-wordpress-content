As awareness of the human impact on the planet is spreading throughout the world, one woman, Brigit Strawbridge, has decided to take action. She was getting tired of everyone <em>talking</em> about going green, but taking little action to actually do so.

Thus, <strong><a href="http://www.thebiggreenidea.org/">The BIG Green Idea</a></strong> was born.

Armed with only her wits and and a <strong>BIG</strong> green bus, Brigit and her team travel around England educating people with practical, hand-on tips to live in a more environmentally friendly way. They converted a double deck bus to teach communities how easy, inexpensive, healthy and rewarding a more sustainable lifestyle can be. <em>Too Cool! </em>So, We have chosen it at the Cause of the Week!

<h2>What is the Big Green Idea all about?</h2>

<h2>Interview with Brigit Strawbridge</h2>

<h3>How did the whole idea come about?</h3>
I wanted to reach as many people as possible with hands-on and practical advice on going green – and to show them how easy it is to reduce your impact <strong>whoever you are.</strong>
<h5><strong> What gives you the motivation to succeed in this endeavor?</strong></h5>
Time is short and I’m tired of everyone talking about green issues rather than doing something about them. We need to do everything we can to get people to change their behaviour asap.
<h3><strong> Why a bus?</strong></h3>
I chose a bus because I wanted something very visual....and have refitted it carefully so it doesn’t look ‘corporate’ and also doesn’t look like ‘the hippies have come to town’! It’s perfect for visits to town centres, schools and big events.
<strong> </strong>
<h5><strong>

</strong><strong>What’s the one thing that people could change about there lifestyle right now, that could make a huge impact on the environment?</strong></h5>
Buy less stuff!
<h3>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</h3>
Try and get funding before you start instead of jumping in with both feet and no funds! Remember that you can’t change the whole world, so just do what you can...anything is better than nothing.

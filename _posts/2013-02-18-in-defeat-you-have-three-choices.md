Bad things happen in life. Sometimes more often then good.

What you do with the bad situations is what will define you.

There are a couple options you have when you have failed:

<ol>
	<li><strong>Letting failure destroy you</strong> - this simply cannot be the case. Nothing great was achieved on the first try. Failure is bound with future success.</li>
	<li><strong>Being defined by your failure</strong> - This is sheer insanity. Things happen. Move on. Being defined as a failure by others is only true if you never try again. </li>
	<li><strong>Learning from failure</strong> - failing fast and iterating quickly are skills that need to be in your toolbox</li>

</ol>

Which will you choose? This is a rhetorical question.

Jim Edgeworth and Marcus Nimmo are about to go road tripping. But this time, instead of stopping in and seeing the world biggest ball of yarn, they are doing it for a good cause. They are roadtripping an astounding <strong>10,000 miles</strong> from Goodwood, England to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. And you thought your commute to work was a long haul?

They are not alone, Several hundred teams from all over the world take part in the event. The event is put on by <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/">The Adventurists</a> and teams enter and then raise money for <a href="http://mercycorps.org.uk/">Mercy Corps</a>, <a href="http://www.fepso.org.ec/">FEBSO</a>, <a href="http://www.frankwater.com/Frank-Water-Projects.html">Frank Water Projects</a>, <a href="http://www.hopeandhomes.org/">Hope and Homes</a>, <a href="http://www.cesvi.org/">CEVSI</a>, <a href="http://www.maitinepal.org/">Maiti Nepal</a>, <a href="http://www.sendacow.org.uk/">Send a Cow</a>, <a href="http://www.cwaf.org.uk/">Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund</a> and the <a href="http://www.camda.org.uk/">Cambridge Mongolian Disaster Appeal</a>.

We here at Socialize Your Cause, think that this is fantastic way to not only raise money for Charity but also a chance to see some interesting places and things! Kudos to <a href="http://mongolrally10.theadventurists.com/index.php?mode=teamwebsites&amp;name=alliance1">Jim and Marcus of Team Alliance in the Mongol Rally</a>! You are our <strong>Cause of the Week!</strong>

<h2><strong>What is the Mongol Rally all about?</strong></h2>
Driving a front line ambulance 10,000 miles from Goodwood, UK to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to donate to a local Hospital and to raise <strong>£25,000</strong> in aid of children and families charities.
<h5><strong>Tell me about the UK Team!</strong></h5>
We are two retired company directors from Darlington, England, Jim Edgeworth and Marcus Nimmo, who have formed a team to take part in the 2010 Mongol Rally. We are probably the oldest participants in the rally, but we hope our many years of experience will offset the grey hair.

<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Ambulance.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-857" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Ambulance" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Ambulance.png" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a>

The Rally is a sponsored Charity event of some <strong>10,000 miles</strong> from Goodwood in England to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, leaving on 24th July 2010, aiming to raise a substantial amount of money for several childrens charities. Several hundred teams from all over the world take part in the event, with vehicles ranging from Fiat Pandas to Fire Engines. The private vehicles are auctioned off by the charities in Ulaanbaatar to raise additional funds, while emergency vehicles, which are desperately needed, are donated directly to the local hospitals or other emergency services. We therefore are taking a front line ambulance, which we know will be of tremendous help to the people of Mongolia, a country with very limited resources.

<strong>Our route</strong> will take us through:- France, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, then into Russia, across the Urals and through Siberia before arriving in Mongolia, finishing in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. We have several mountain ranges plus a desert or two to negotiate.
<h3><strong>How did the whole idea come about? </strong></h3>
I really can't remember the details, it all started off by a casual comment over a drink which grew over the next few weeks until Marcus one day announced that he had signed us up for it.  Besides, we had nothing else planned.
<h5><strong>What gives you the motivation to succeed in your cause? </strong></h5>
<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/mongolianambulance.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-852" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="mongolianambulance" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/mongolianambulance.png" alt="" width="277" height="209" /></a>
Every other year, Marcus allows Bobby Roberts Circus to pitch up in a field in his small farm on the outskirts of Darlington.  Some of the circus artists are Mongolian and Marcus and his wife Liz became friends with them.  They are still in regular contact with a couple of their aunts who came for a visit one year, one of whom was a hospital nurse and she sent a picture of a Mongolian ambulance, just look at the pic and you will understand why we are taking an ex NHS Front Line Ambulance.

What started off as a bit of a laugh for two retired, bored businessmen, has turned into a serious project and we are determined to get the ambulance to the hospital in Mongolia, plus raise a substantial sum for our charities; The Christina Noble Childrens Foundation and Mercy Corps.  It is also our intention to support another childrens charity right here in the UK, as we are amateurs at this charity thing, we have asked some experienced folk to help us pick one where the money goes to helping kids, rather than overheads.
<h3><strong>You mention that there are several hundred teams across the world participating in the event, How did the race begin?</strong></h3>
Check out "The Adventurists" website and all will be explained:- <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.theadventurists.com/index.php</a> Be sure to look at the charities page!
<h5><strong>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor? </strong></h5>
Go for it!!! But do it with your eyes wide open, this is not for everyone, there is no glamour, it is bloody dangerous and hard work and there is ABSOLUTELY NO back up or support.

What you will get at the end of 10,000 miles, driving on what are laughingly called roads, over several mountain ranges and a desert or two and providing you are not kidnapped, shot or thrown in a Russian gulag and assuming that you havn't broken down in the middle of the Gobi desert, is the look on the faces of a couple of hundred or so orphans as you hand out the sweets that you brought all the way from the UK.  An added bonus for us will be the look of sheer amazement on the faces of the hospital staff when they get their modern fully equipped ambulance, complete with stretcher and Blues &amp; Two's!

While you will get help from a few generous souls by fundraising, it will still be expensive.  So far we have paid out £5000 for the ambulance and £700 Rally fees with still to pay about £2-3000 for fuel, £1000 for insurance, £600 for Visas, £1600 flights home, plus food and the occasional budget hotel to enable us to have a bath when we get a bit ripe. Like I said, eyes wide open.

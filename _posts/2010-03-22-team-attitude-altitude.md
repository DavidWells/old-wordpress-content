<strong>Looking for an incredible way to raise funds for your cause?</strong>

Deb Hunt, Annemarie Smith, Helen Taylor and Audra Selley have done just that. Meet Team Attitude at Altitude, a group of UK women who are not afraid to scale one of the tallest mountains in the world for a cause they are extremely passionate about. They are planning on climbing to the top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro">Mt Kilimanjaro</a> in an effort to raise funds and awareness for breast cancer research!

They set out to reach a target goal of  £20,000.  They have already managed to raise over £17,000 in just 6 months, Amazing! With 6 months to go until the trek the sky is the limit. You can <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/attitudeataltitude">donate to their cause here.</a>

We wish Team Attitude at Altitude the best of luck! They will be tweeting out of the @YouCanHelp Twitter Account this week, so keep an eye out for that and help them spread the word!
<h3>How did the whole idea come about?<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/teamalt2.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1022" title="Team Attitude at Altitude" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/teamalt2.png" alt="" width="310" height="210" /></a></h3>
I (Debs) was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2008. Following all my treatment (mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy) I decided to do a skydive and raise money for Breakthrough Breast Cancer. I did that in May 2009 and shortly afterwards myself and 3 good friends decided that we should all do something 'big' to raise some more money for the charity. Over several glasses of wine we foolishly decided that we were going to do Kilimanjaro!
<h5>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</h5>
It's close to my heart for obvious reasons but also one of the other girls in the team has had both her Mum and her sister go through it too. There is a woman diagnosed with breast cancer every 11 mins in the UK and <strong>1 in 9 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer</strong> at some point in their lifetime. Between the four of us in the team we have 6 beautiful daughters so we need to raise the funds to ensure that the researchers make the breakthrough needed to protect our children's generation.
<h3>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</h3>
A Twitter friend <a href="http://twitter.com/AnnaAntell">@AnnaAntell</a> (herself being treated for breast cancer at the moment) has organised a Creme Tea and Bluebell Walk on May1st in Tubney, Oxfordshire. It is being advertised on Twitter and Facebook with all the proceeds going to our fundraising.
<h5>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</h5>
Don't do it!!!! No, seriously I think my best advice is to make sure you do it with a few friends. The four of us have worked as a team with all the fundraising and it has made that side of it much easier and more enjoyable than it would have been individually. Also the actual challenge of climbing Mt Kilimanjaro will be easier to bear with friends there to motivate and lift morale when things get tough.
<h3>What do you have planned for the future of this cause?</h3>
We set ourselves a target of raising £20,000 for the charity. We are heading towards £17,000 raised so far so we are hoping that with 6 months to go we will be able to go beyond our target. We are planning to hold a Track Day and hopefully a Golf Day too. People can keep up to date with whats going on by checking our website <a href="http://www.twin-peaks.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.twin-peaks.co.uk</a> or follow us on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/4pinkbras">@4pinkbras</a>) or follow our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110436137773&amp;ref=search&amp;sid=5235598.3510763806..1">Facebook Group 4PinkBras</a>. Donations can also be made at <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/attitudeataltitude" target="_blank">www.justgiving.com/attitudeataltitude</a>

We take part in the Kilimanjaro Summit Challenge on 16th September 2010 and we are all determined to make it to the top, raise breast cancer awareness and hopefully lots of dosh too!

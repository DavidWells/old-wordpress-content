The non-profit appeals to the good nature of their donors, rather than a specific product or service. This fact makes the mountain of charity fundraising more difficult to climb. Fortunately, marketing plans of for-profit companies can be incorporated into the non-profit fundraising strategies. Here are some methods for subtle fundraising in the non-profit arena.
<h3><strong>1. Identify your demographic</strong></h3>
While you want everyone to give to your cause, there are some people who are more likely to donate. What types of donors give the most money? Are you interested in the corporate demographic? Do you want to target the soccer moms? The scatter approach dilutes the messages that you provide. Examine your demographic and target your resources.
<h5><strong>2. Use social networking</strong></h5>
Social networking is an excellent way to communicate your message. Give fans information on upcoming events. Tell your story to the world. Make regular updates with information about your cause, as well as articles which may emphasize the need for donation. As a part of personal branding, your profile should be the same in each of the social media outlets.
<h3><strong>3. Your website is essential:</strong></h3>
Your website needs to be up-to-date with current events. Take a few pictures of the people you have helped. Take a few pictures of your headquarters. Websites are the focal point of a charity's endeavors. Make a donation button to capture the emotions of your viewers. Highlight your donors so they receive an ego boost. If your website needs to be revamped, investigate the possibility of offering free publicity to local designers.

<h5>4. Advertise your achievements</h5>
<strong></strong>Gain more exposure by placing simple advertisements in the local classifieds. Tell everyone that you have served a thousand meals in the past month. How many lives have been saved through the use of your service? Your website and social marketing avenues are designed to advertise your organization's accomplishments. When people see that they are backing a winner, they will feel compelled to donate.
<h3><strong>5. Tell a story</strong></h3>
Positive relationships are built on storytelling. Take an individual who has benefited from your services and make them the poster child for your organization. Let that person be the spokesperson. Donors do not wish to hear from people asking for money, they want to hear about the advantages of your organization. Tell a story which appeals to the emotional side of your cause.
<h5><strong>6. Events</strong></h5>
<strong></strong> Charities hold events. When you hold an event, you are drawing attention to the charity's work. You are cementing its relationship with the community. The event provides another venue to demonstrate your organization's great work. Be creative and memorable.
<h3><strong>7. Newsletters</strong></h3>
Newsletters are a common method for companies to sell products. This strategy also works for nonprofits. Encourage your visitors to opt-in to your mailing list using a free fact sheet. Send your readers a newsletter on a regular schedule. When your donors see your organization's logo, they will know your ultimate purpose. You do not have to provide a hard sales pitch for your charity.
<h5><strong>8. Offer incentives</strong></h5>
Your donors want to get a sense of instant satisfaction for their donation. Offer them a free gift at certain donation levels. Make sure that your donation levels are accessible for everyone, starting with a very small amount. Solicit donations from companies for free products and services for your donors.
<h3>9. Start projects</h3>
Start a project with a definitive beginning, middle, and end. Highlight a single aspect of your organization. Government agencies are more likely to provide grants to specific projects rather than organizations as a whole. Your charity needs to create specific initiatives which are within your mission statement's boundaries.
<h5><strong>10. Coordinate with related agencies</strong></h5>
More exposure means more money. Look at the other agencies within your area. You are not in competition with them, you are striving to make the world a better place. Are there charities or other non-profit organizations which provide the next step? When you coordinate with those other organizations, you make the event stronger.

<strong>Your donor list forms the foundation for your charity. Cultivate your list using newsletters, promotions, and social media. Each connection brings you closer to your goals.</strong>

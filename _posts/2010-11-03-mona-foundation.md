Mona  Foundation is a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization that supports  grassroots initiatives focused on education and raising the status of  women and girls in the US and abroad. We believe that universal  education and gender equity are the cornerstones of the eradication of  poverty, disease, and conflict.  We pursue these principles by offering  support to grassroots educational projects that meet our project  selection criteria.  We believe that every member of our human family  can become an active participant in the process of developing themselves  and their communities.  Mona Foundation provides our supporters the  opportunity to contribute to a worldwide network of initiatives.

We  believe that education is a human right and a social responsibility.   In hand with that, the advancement of civilization requires the full  participation of everyone, including women.  United Nations research  documents the correlation between a variety of crucial development  indicators and the education of girls and women.  From infant mortality  reductions, fertility, and the incidence of AIDS to improvements in the  environment, evidences demonstrate that education of women and girls  makes the difference.

People  can feel confident that their support will make a difference and have a  direct impact because Mona Foundation sends 100% of all designated  funds to the projects it supports and 97% of general funds.

HOW DID THE WHOLE IDEA COME ABOUT?
Mona  Foundation was started by a small group of people committed to service.   They learned about the great work that a group of humble people were  doing in different countries and decided that they wanted to help.  They  consulted, formed a non-profit in 1999, started with supporting two  projects in two countries, and never gave up.  Today Mona Foundation  supports 20 projects in 11 countries, touching the lives of more than  30,000 children, women and their families.

WHY IS THIS CAUSE CLOSE TO YOUR HEART?  WHY SHOULD OTHERS SUPPORT IT?
One  of the co-founders and current president of Mona Foundation, Mahnaz A.  Javid, came from Iran as a teenager where girls are often educated  second to boys, and later worked at the UN as a translator speaking to  countless refugees and victims of political persecution.  These insights  were the first seeds for Mona Foundation.  After a young boy she knew  committed suicide, the seeds grew into determined resolve to ‘not let  another child slip through her hands if she could do something about  it’.

Most  people reading this are fortunate enough to not have to experience the  treatment of their daughters as second class citizens or to not be able  to afford to send their children to school or to even have them go  hungry.  It takes as little as $30/month to sponsor a child so that they  can receive an education and at least one full meal a day and a chance  at a building a better life for them, for their family, and for their  community.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER EVENTS OR FUNDRAISERS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE OTHERS TO KNOW ABOUT?
Mona  Foundation, which is based out of the Seattle area, just held a very  successful benefit at The Paramount Theatre in Seattle with  actor/comedian Rainn Wilson from ‘The Office’ and a crew of his friends  like Craig Robinson also from ‘The Office’, The Presidents of the United  States of America, Andy Grammer and more!  It was almost a sold-out  crowd and really helped us to establish our name and presence in the  Seattle area, creating awareness while having a lot of fun.

It  will be hard to top that for a while, but we do have a small luncheon  planned for November in Bellevue which we are very excited about.  Our  guest speaker will be Dr. Randy Wang, co-founder of Digital Study Hall, a  project that empowers teachers and educates students in rural and urban  slum schools in India.

HOW HAS SOCIAL MEDIA HELPED YOUR ORGANIZATION?
The  event at The Paramount Theatre was a good lesson in social media for  us.  Mona Foundation only entered into the social media scene in 2008  with the creation of a Facebook group, and now of course we are active  on Twitter and YouTube and really try to manage our online presence.  We  fully recognize that social media is a great tool for nonprofits –  however, while it is often free, and it is an endless possibilities of  networks, it takes planning and manpower to fully utilize and capitalize  upon.  We are a very small staffed organization and have embraced these  tools as best we can at this time.

Mona  Foundation uses Facebook and Twitter to communicate regularly to our  online community.  A recent example is when Mona Foundation was  nominated for Best Local Favorite Charity in Western Washington.  After  using our social media platforms to get the word out, our online support  base really rallied behind us and got the vote out and we are very  proud to say that we were presented with the award this past weekend!   We saw the great ripple effect of social media with votes coming in not  only from our current online community but also from people connected  to someone in our online community and people connected to them, etc.

One  of our goals for the next five years is to increase our use of the  power of the internet, digital marketing and social media platforms.  We  have begun this by re-developing our website to become fully integrated  with Facebook, this new version of our website just went live last week  and we are looking forward to seeing the results of building our online  community.

WHAT DO YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE OF MONA FOUNDATION?
Looking  forward, we know that for every one child that we can provide support  to in the world there are hundreds more waiting and needing that same  support.   For every school we support, there are 10 schools waiting  that meet our criteria and have our confidence that they would  contribute equally to the social and economic development of their  communities.

Rather  than prioritize projects based on geography, our strategy is to go  where we can have the greatest impact – where we can make long-term  change most effectively.   Over the next five years Mona Foundation  plans to:  increase our reach by 50% year over year; increase our  financial capacity by 50% year over year; increase use of the power of  social media; eliminate the privately funded operations fund; and  sustain the systematic growth of the Foundation.  Some audacious goals,  but we are excited and ready to take them on and are already well on our  way!

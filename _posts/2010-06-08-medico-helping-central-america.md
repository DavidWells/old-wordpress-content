So look out for their tweet coming from our twitter accounts for the week and make sure to become a <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/MEDICO.ProvidingCare.IgnitingHope">fan of their facebook page.</a></strong>

<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/medico1.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="medico" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/medico_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="medico" width="237" height="244" align="right" /></a>
<h3><strong>How did Medico start?</strong></h3>
In 1990, along with three friends, David and Marian Flowers and Jim Durham, Norm and Lynda Peters founded <strong><a href="http://medico.org/">MEDICO,</a></strong> an independent, non-faith-based organization. They expected the organization to be a small group that would take a few teams of volunteers to Central America every year. But the more they worked, the more they realized that there was great need for their services. They expanded MEDICO to include 6 – 8 medical brigades per year and an Adopt-a-Village model, working with officials in host communities to emphasize a holistic, sustainable approach, more education and more preventive care.
<h5><strong>Why is this cause close to your heart?</strong></h5>
Slightly more than half of Hondurans and 48 percent of Nicaraguans live in poverty and have very high risks for major infectious diseases, including bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A and typhoid fever. MEDICO provides medical, eye and dental care to these people where they have little or no access to health care. I love that MEDICO also focuses on solving some of the core issues contributing to their health concerns such as water contamination and poor air quality in their homes. With officials in host communities, MEDICO works to improve water filtration, and building water tanks and latrines. They also help residents build stoves with proper ventilation — a response to asthma and other chronic and widespread respiratory problems doctors were treating. Through the efforts of MEDICO, an expectant mother receives prenatal care, a little girl can walk normally after club foot surgery, and a child obtains books and paper for classes. Since 1990, volunteers from all over the world have helped make this a reality for the people of Latin America.

<h3><strong>Why should others support it?</strong></h3>
<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/medico21.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="medico2" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/medico2_thumb1.png" border="0" alt="medico2" width="239" height="218" align="right" /></a> MEDICO’s greatest strength is its volunteers. MEDICO achieves this mission through the participation of medical and non-medical volunteers serving in many different capacities. Participation includes field team response, warehouse volunteering, funding, administrative support and more. Dedicated trip participants give a week of their lives, sharing their skills with people who would not otherwise have access to health care. Volunteers at the MEDICO warehouse pack, organize, condense, and shelve shipments of supplies for each of the teams. Individuals and organizations donate necessary medicines and equipment.

MEDICO’s operating funds come entirely from tax-deductible donations. Contributions from individuals and organizations make it possible to purchase medicines and fund special projects.

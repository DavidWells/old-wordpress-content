This week’s Cause of the Week, comes to us from the big apple. The <a href="http://www.bigsnyc.org/"><strong>Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City</strong></a> has been steering kids in the right direction since 1904!

We, here at Socialize Your Cause, believe that <strong>everyone should have a role model</strong> and a mentor to look up to. Getting advice from people who have <strong>been there and done that</strong> is extremely helpful and a must with most things in life!

The Big Brother Big Sister Program does an amazing job with their Young Mentoring programs they have been able to make some truly <a href="http://www.bigsnyc.org/v-stories.php"><strong>extraordinary matches</strong></a> between mentors and the kids.

<h3><strong>How did the whole idea come about?</strong></h3>
<strong>A Brief history:</strong>

<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BigBrothersBigSisters.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Big Brothers Big Sisters" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BigBrothersBigSisters_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Big Brothers Big Sisters" width="244" height="183" align="right" /></a> It was more than century ago, on December 3, 1904, in Lower Manhattan. A boy's life hung in the balance, the weight of an 18-month reformatory sentence about to crush his future. Then Ernest Coulter, Clerk of the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York, made his famous plea:

"There is only one possible way to save that youngster, and that is to have some earnest, true man volunteer to be his big brother. To look after him, to help him do right, to make the little chap feel that there is at least one human being in this great city who takes a personal interest in him, who cares whether he lives or dies. I call for a volunteer."

When the first gentleman stood to volunteer, Big Brothers of New York City (the founding chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America) began. Coulter's audience, a New York City men's club of business and community leaders, immediately saw the strength of this brave new idea. By the end of the day, 39 men had volunteered, and thus 39 futures were salvaged.

Eight years later, in June of 1912, Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt helped to form the Big Sisters organization. In 1921, the Big Brother and Big Sister Federation incorporated in New York State. Today, Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City reaches over 3,000 young people every year with many different mentoring programs designed to meet the unique and changing needs of the children, families and volunteers in our City.
<h3><strong>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</strong></h3>
Mentoring is a cause that everyone can relate to, because everyone at some point in their lives has benefited from the positive influence of a mentor…a friend, a teacher, a guide, a listener, a supporter and a confidante. Personally, growing up without a father in my life, I know the importance of having someone step up to help fill that gap, someone who cares, encourages and truly believes in you so you can thrive and succeed. And, looking back I see the different path my life could have taken had I not had a role model to help me make the right decisions. People should support mentoring because it works. Mentoring has the Power to Change Lives.

<h3><strong>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</strong></h3>
People who want to give back by becoming a volunteer mentor will see their direct, amazing impact on a child in need. Our measurable outcomes, such as significant increases in self-confidence, school attendance and performance, demonstrate the remarkable improvements and transformations in the youth we serve. And, as a BBBS of NYC volunteer mentor, you will change not only a child’s life but your own. Being a Big Brother or Big Sister is a one-year commitment, but the rewards last a lifetime.

You never go it alone. Each Big/Little match is supervised by a professionally-trained social worker who is always there to help you with support and suggestions.  And, we have many <a href="http://www.bigsnyc.org/v-groups.php">volunteer groups</a> for peer support, advice, encouragement and networking.

It’s a fun, rewarding experience and there are as many reasons to be a mentor as there are mentors. Learn more and find your reason. We have hundreds of children, mostly boys, who are just waiting for you.

We are a donor-supported volunteer organization, so you can also take on the cause of mentoring by making a <a href="http://www.bigsnyc.org/donate.php">financial contribution</a>. As a donor, you will see the tremendous value of your contributions, and will learn that the power of your dollar is exponential. Not only will you change a disadvantaged child’s life, you’ll have a lasting impact on every life that child touches now and in the future. When you donate to Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City, that’s your legacy.
<h3><strong>How has social media helped your organization?</strong></h3>
Through social media, we have been able to reach out to a more individuals than we ever dreamed possible.  We are able to raise awareness, visibility and support for our cause, post content to share the compelling <a href="http://www.bigsnyc.org/v-stories.php">stories of our Big/Little matches</a> and spread the word about our events, partnerships, accomplishments and great match activities instantly.  Also, it has helped create an online bridge between us and the other BBBS chapters around the world. We share information and best practices, support each other’s efforts and have been able to try new things, learn and grow.  We have networked and connected on a new level with our individual and corporate supporters as well as businesses and other nonprofit organizations in our community and beyond. Social media is the future, not only of the world but of the nonprofit sector, and we are happy to be a part of it.
<h3><strong>What do you have planned for the future of </strong><strong>Big Brothers Big Sisters of NYC</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>
Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City serves about 3,000 of the more than 428,500 children currently living below the poverty line in our community, which includes 149,000 single-parent families. These underprivileged youth live in the roughest neighborhoods and are confronted with negative influences like school violence, crime, drugs and gangs every day.

Our vision is to ensure that every New York City youth who needs and wants the positive influence of a Big Brother or Big Sister will have one. Generous donations of time and/or money can help make our vision a reality.

<h3>How did the whole idea come about?</h3>
The idea started shortly after a vacation to the Philippines.  Founder Christine Umayam couldn't forget the images of the children when she came back to America.  It was a nagging feeling inside of her that told her she needed to do something more.   She ended up quitting her lucrative job in the corporate world to start Child United.

Christine's mission now is to help children in third world countries receive an education with the belief that it can lead a child, their family, and eventually a community... out of poverty.
<h5>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</h5>
<strong> </strong>

This cause is close to my heart because of what I personally saw in third world countries.  Poverty in the third world is drastically different than in America.  Sometimes we forget that poverty is really about survival.  It's about what you're eating that day, if you can eat at all.  It affects about 1 billion children worldwide and its something that's easily preventable.

I believe uplifting these children and giving them a chance for an education will help them out of the cycle of poverty.  One educated and knowledgeable child has the chance to dream and realize what their potential is.  Most often, a child who is given the chance also provides help to another.

Others need to care and support children in the third world.  We live in the most prosperous nation, and, as individuals, we have a vested interest in helping those less fortunate.  Everyone deserves the opportunity to do something with their lives and providing them with that opportunity is not only uplifting a child's life but fulfilling yours at the same time.
<h3>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</h3>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Child United is partnering with Jeepney Clothing at one of Seattle's most popular cultural events during Seafair.  On August 1, CU will be raising awareness at Pista Sa Nayon in Seattle's Seward Park.

Our biggest fundraising gala of the year is scheduled in September.  Child United intends to raise $150,000.  The money will send 200 sponsored children to school, build two learning centers and an office, send three containers filled with donated schools books and supplies overseas and help send Child United officers to Asia to seek out orphanages/schools to provide for.
<h3>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</h3>
<strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong>

Just do it!  When you feel your passion, follow it through.  Support a cause you truly believe in and stand by it 100%
<h5>How has social media helped your organization?</h5>
<strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong>

Child United utilizes many social media tools to raise awareness.

<strong>Social Media provides us with a bigger network of supporters.</strong> Supporters can stay connected and get involved.  Whether it's an instant donation or telling us what they think.

It also helps us because we are a grassroots organization with little money for marketing.  Social media is a great and free way to market ourselves to people worldwide.
<h3>What do you have planned for the future of Child United?</h3>
Our goal is to help millions of children around the world.  In order to do this, Child United intends to establish offices and networks throughout the world, promoting education to children, schools and orphanages.

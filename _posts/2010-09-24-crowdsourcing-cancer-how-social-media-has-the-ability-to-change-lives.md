Her “aha moment” for using these social media channels was when she saw a tweet about another Chemo patient that was reaching out for treatment suggestions. She immediately responded and started up a dialog with her fellow survivor.

The ease of reaching out and connecting was astonishing.

<strong>“Status updates are instantaneous and they reach that they have is enormous”</strong> she exclaims<strong>, </strong>as she watched the online community of cancer survivors and supporters retweet and update their facebook status’s which one of the queries from a Chemo patient in need.

Using the power of the crowdsourcing cancer community they are solving treatment questions and helping to guide new chemo patients to useful resources that they themselves once turned to.

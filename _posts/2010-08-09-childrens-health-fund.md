<p>We are proud to announce this week's <strong>Cause of the Week,</strong> the <strong><a href="http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/">Children's Health Fund</a></strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/childrenshealth.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="childrens-health" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/childrenshealth_thumb.png" border="0" alt="childrens-health" width="254" height="182" align="right" /></a> How did the whole idea come about?</h3>
<p>After a year of visiting New York City's welfare hotels and researching the needs of the City's homeless, Irwin Redlener, MD and Paul Simon launched CHF in 1987 to provide health care to homeless and medically underserved kids.  CHF launched its first program, the New York Children's Health Project (NYCHP), with one "big blue van," a state-of-the-art mobile medical clinic that would bring medical care directly to those children with the least access.</p>
<h5>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</h5>
<p>We don't have any public events coming in the near future, but we do have a fun way for baseball fans to help support CHF through the Yankees Home Run Club:  <a href="http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/how-to-help/Yankees-home-run-club">http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/how-to-help/Yankees-home-run-club</a></p>
<h3>What do you have planned for the future of Children's Health Fund?</h3>
<p>CHF is growing across the country, hiring more doctors and nurses to help the most vulnerable children across the US.  We have plans for a new mobile clinic in Detroit, expansion in the Gulf Coast to help children impacted by the oil spill, and a brand new Maternal Child Health Center in the South Bronx (NYC) all before 2010 is complete.</p>

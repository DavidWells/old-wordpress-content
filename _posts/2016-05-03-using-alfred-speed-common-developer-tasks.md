[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is an amazingly useful tool for quickly opening programs and turning a bunch of clicks into simple commands.

One of my favorite Alfred workflows is opening up my current finder window in my terminal with the [alfred-terminalfinder](https://github.com/LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder).

See it in action here:

Here is the [github alfred extension](https://github.com/gharlan/alfred-github-workflow) I demonstrated in the video. It's handy for jumping to github repos & checking on issues you have assigned etc.

Also, check out this [collection of Alfred 2 workflows that will rock your world](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows). 

**Do you have any favorite Alfred workflows or other dev automation tips?**

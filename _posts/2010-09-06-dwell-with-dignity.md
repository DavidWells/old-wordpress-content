Like they say, <em>everything is bigger in Texas</em>, and this week’s cause of the week lives up to the claim. <strong><a href="http://www.dwellwithdignity.org">Dwell with Dignity</a></strong>, a Dallas based non-profit group, of Interior Designers and volunteers is on a mission to help the less fortunate in a <strong>BIG</strong> way. They help to create inspiring homes for families struggling with homelessness and poverty.

<a href="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dwellwithdignity.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="dwell with dignity" src="http://www.davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dwellwithdignity_thumb.png" border="0" alt="dwell with dignity" width="197" height="244" align="right" /></a>Just over a year old, this grassroots non-profit, has taken on a <a href="http://www.dwellwithdignity.org/Projects.html">ton of projects</a> and has an extremely dedicated and caring group of volunteers and supporters.

Their mission is to help families escape poverty and homelessness through design. The Socialize Your Cause team is a huge fan of design, both on and off of the internet. =).

The families they are helping are dedicated to changing their lives by learning to become self-sufficient. These families reside in single-family homes and apartments that are provided by social service agencies or attained with the assistance of such agencies.

They find the families in need by working with existing social service organizations that have programs in place to help struggling families attain self sufficiency.

Dwell with Dignity is also leveraging the power of social media to further their goals. They use Facebook, Blogger and Twitter daily!

Read their blog at <a href="http://www.dwellwdignity.blogspot.com">www.dwellwdignity.blogspot.com</a> and where they chronicle their adventures installing homes, interior designers, artists, students and volunteers coming together to create soothing homes for the families.  Their blog is also a haven for which our volunteers can share their design and art skills offering tips and tricks of the trade and amazing D-I-Y and how-to projects.

Tweet with them at <a href="http://twitter.com/dwellwthdignity">twitter.com/dwellwthdignity</a> as we offer tips, design photos, install updates and other related announcements.

They post everything from before and after photos, volunteer meetings, blog posts, when we need help and other related announcements. We like to keep our fans in the mix and update as much as we can.

And keep an eye out for their tweets coming from <strong>@Youcanhelp, @SocializedCause, &amp; @CauseofTheWeek</strong> for the week!

<h3>How did the whole idea come about?</h3>
I (<strong>Lisa Robison</strong>, Founder/President/Executive Director of Dwell with Dignity) am an Interior Designer by trade, and wanted to give back to my community while doing what I love to do.  I had read a quote by Oprah championing the idea that to find fulfillment in life, you should find what you love to do and serve your community with your passion and talent.  At first, I thought "well how can I do that?  My profession serves a privileged clientele!" Upon greater reflection, I realized that everyone can benefit from the comfort and peace of mind that comes with a soothing, beautiful and orderly environment. I asked my husband for the "seed money" to start Dwell with Dignity for my Birthday  in 2009, and that was the beginning of quite a ride!
<h5>Why is this cause close to your heart? Why should other support it?</h5>
If you can change a person's environment, you can change their life. There are many families who have lived for generations in poverty, and have never been exposed to living with the dignity and peace that comes with opportunity and support.  Exposing children, especially, to this new standard of living can help to break the cycle of poverty.  Our residents feel safe, calm and valued in their homes.
<h3>Do you have any other events or fundraisers that you would like others to know about?</h3>
We are launching a membership drive and our  "Ready Aim ReDesign" before and after contest in the next few weeks. We will award fabulous prizes for the best furniture make-overs. You can go here to become a member now.  Check with us on Facebook and Twitter to hear more info about the contest set to launch on September 15th.
<h5>What advice would you give to others that might like to take on such an amazing endeavor?</h5>
Go for it, listen to your inner voice, and as Goethe once said, <strong>" Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. "</strong>
<h3>How has social media helped your organization?</h3>
Social media keeps us connected with our volunteers and donors.  We are able to communicate important information quickly to the people who care about our mission and we reach a targeted group of individuals who share the interests of our supporters.  We also learn about new opportunities for our organization and make the connections needed to facilitate action.  Brilliant!
<h5>What do you have planned for the future of  Dwell with Dignity?</h5>
As Dwell with Dignity continues to grow, we hope to raise the funds necessary to sustain our growth and hire a small staff.  We would like to inspire  more lives with design, and focus on sustainable ways to make this happen.
